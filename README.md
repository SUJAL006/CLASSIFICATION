#  COMPUTATION  


1.**HOST**- A host is any hardware device that has the capability of permitting access to a network via a user interface, specialized software, network address, protocol stack, or any other means.
  
2.**CPU**- The component of a computer system that controls the interpretation and execution of instructions. The CPU of a PC consists of a single microprocessor, while the CPU of a more powerful mainframe consists of multiple processing devices, and in some cases, hundreds of them.  

3.**ALU**- An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic and logic operations. It's a fundamental building block of a computer's central processing unit (CPU).ALUs perform operations on:
- Integer binary numbers
- Instruction words
- Bitwise operations  
 
 4.**DPU**- A data processing unit (DPU) is a programmable computer processor that integrates a CPU with network interface hardware. DPUs are also known as "IPUs" (infrastructure processing units) or "SmartNICs".DPUs are used in data centers to:
- Move data around
- Handle networking functions
- Relieve the CPU from data processing jobs
  
5.**GPU**-A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a chip that renders graphics for display on an electronic device.GPUs are designed to accelerate computer graphics and image processing.They can perform mathematical calculations at high speed. Computing tasks like: 
- Graphics rendering
- Machine learning (ML) 
- Video editing

6.OPERATING SYSTEM-  
- a.Windows
- b.MacOS

7. KERNEL--that manages operations between computer and hardware.

8. VM(virtual machine)-virtualization

  type-1 (server with no operating system) ex:XEN,KVM

  type-2 (server with operating system) EX: VM WARE,ORACLE

9. CONTAINER  
  -Docker container  
  -linux container(LXC)  

  ORCHESTRATION CONTAINERS(manage service with container)
  
  -KUBERNETES(K8S)
  
  -DOCKER SWARM
  
  -MESOS
  
  -EKS(Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service)
  
  -ECS(Elastic container service)  
  
  -user space and kernel space


  - eBPF 

  - DUAL BOOT

  - IAAS

  - KAAS

# STORAGE
1.**SAN**-A storage area network (SAN) is a dedicated high-speed network or subnetwork that interconnects and presents shared pools of storage devices to multiple servers. The availability and accessibility of storage are critical concerns for enterprise computing.  

2.**BACKUPS**-The term backing storage refers to any non-volatile data storage that will retain a computer's data even after the computer is powered off.  

3..**NFS**-NFS stands for Network File System. It is a file system mechanism that allows users to store and retrieve data from multiple disks and directories across a shared network. NFS is a distributed file system protocol that allows users to access files and directories located on remote computers and treat those files and directories as if they were local. 

4.**OBJECT STORAGE**-A computer data storage architecture designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data.  
  
5.**DISK IOPS**-Tells how many operations a disk drive can perform per second  
  -**THROUGHPUT**-Tells how much data can be processed per second  
  -**LATENCY**-the time required for a sub-system to process a single data request or transaction.  
  
6.**DATABASES**-All the information in a database is organized and structured in database tables. These tables are stored on the hard disk of the database server.  

7.**KEY-VALUE STORES**-A key-value store, or key-value database is a simple database that uses an associative array (think of a map or dictionary) as the fundamental data model where each key is associated with one and only one value in a collection. This relationship is referred to as a key-value pair.  

# NETWORK  

1.**OSI MODEL**- The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network. It was the first standard model for network communications, adopted by all major computer and telecommunication companies in the early 1980s.  

2.**TCP-IP MODEL**-TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extranet).  

3.**NETWORK TOPOLOGIES**-Topology defines the structure of the network of how all the components are interconnected to each other. There are two types of topology: physical and logical topology.  
-**TYPES OF NETWORK TOPOLOIGIES**
   -BUS  
   -RING  
   -TREE  
   -STAR  
   -MESH  
   -HYBRID  

4.**CIDR Notations**-CIDR notation represents an IP address and a suffix that indicates network identifier bits in a specified format. For example, you could express 192.168.1.0 with a 22-bit network identifier as 192.168.1.0/22.  

5.**SUBNETTING**-The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting. Creating a subnet by dividing the host identifier.

6.PUBLIC NETWORK & PRIVATE NETWORK  

7.**STATIC/DYNAMIC IPs**-
